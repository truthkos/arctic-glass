Arctic Glass
=======

This is a location-specific application built for researchers and students to use while conducting their work on the North Slope of Alaska. The application is primarily controlled through voice command, and includes a wildlife identification feature, retrieval of archival time-lapse imagery, and real-time sensor monitoring. 

Arctic Glass is programmed in the Java language and makes heavy use of many features of the Google Glass API, specifically menu navigation though the Voice API. The current version of the software has the capability to access data on-demand from the web, but the feature is only partially enabled right now due to time constraints and priority while building the proof-of-concept for field testing.

Features:

- Arctic Flora & Fauna Identification Guide
- Real-time sensor monitoring for PUPS (IoT) devices
- Real-time live trap monitoring
- Time-lapse archive image retrieval (for overlay view on-site)
